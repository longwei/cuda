// Asynchronous Memory Prefetching

// This technique reduces overhead from page faults and on-demand memory migrations in host-to-device and device-to-host transfers.
// It allows asynchronous migration of unified memory (UM) to any CPU or GPU in the system before use, improving GPU kernel and CPU function performance.
